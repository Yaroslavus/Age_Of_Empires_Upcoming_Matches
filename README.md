1. General information:

AOE 2 Live Timetable is designed for online monitoring of Age Of Empires 2 tournaments.

With this application you can see:
- What tournaments are taking place right now. For these tournaments:
- - a list of games currently running (live);
- - a list of games announced for the near future, and a countdown to their beginning;
- What tournaments are expected in the future.

For additional information before starting, you can look at the screenshot of the working version in this directory (AOE_2_Live_Timetable_Screenshot.png):

Also, all tournaments are clickable, by clicking on the title of the tournament you can go to its page on liquipedia.net.

2. What you should know:

- All information shown by the application is taken from the main page
liquipedia.net/ageofempires/Age_of_Empires_II. If some of the information about the game/tournament is not there, it will not be in the application either. This happens, for example, for the Stage field, which is sometimes not written on the tournament page (example - Admirals League, 03-04.2023). In this case, None will be written in the corresponding field. And again - if some links on this resource are not working, they will not run in this application either.

- Also at the top there is a link to the page itself liquipedia.net/ageofempires/Age_of_Empires_II.

- The application requires Internet access. The application goes online:
- - during launching;
- - when manually refreshing the form (button in the upper left corner);
- - at the end of the nearest game (because the end time of the games is unknown, the application considers the game ended 4 hours after the start. For 95% of the games (except for extravagant events, such as the Red Bull Wololo final) this should be enough).

- This release works only under Windows (I hope, only currently).

3. How to run:

- If you are reading this on GitHub, then at the very beginning, download the AOE_2_Live_Timetable_Windows.rar archive to your computer.

- Inside the archive AOE_2_Live_Timetable_Windows.rar there is an executable file AOE_2_Live_Timetable.exe. You can (to avoid unnecessary actions) run it directly from the archive, or you can unpack the archive beforehand (for example, to place a shortcut to the executable file on the desktop).

4. Don't skip games, enjoy :)
